  title={A Test of Justification Bias Based on High-Frequency Data of Health and Retirement},
  author={Jiayi Wen and Zixi Ye and Xuan Zhang},
  abstract={   Justification bias, wherein retirees tend to report worse health to justify their retirement, is a key concern when use self-rated health as the measure in retirement studies. However, previous research predominantly tests its existence indirectly. Exploiting a unique high-frequency data that provides monthly information on employment and health, this paper tests this bias using a method in the spirit of regression discontinuity. The identification assumption is that abrupt change in self-rated health immediately after retirement is more likely attributed to reporting bias instead of actual health. Benchmark results show that retirement leads to worse self-rated health, a pattern in line with the justification bias. However, the effect diminishes as the window around retirement shrinks, suggesting an absence of this bias. Our direct method also validates the conventional approach, as both methods yield consistent conclusions.},

  title={Occupational Retirement and Pension Reform: The Roles of Physical and Cognitive Health},
  author={Jiayi Wen},
  abstract={Despite increasing cognitive demands of jobs, knowledge about the role of health in retirement has centered on its physical dimensions. This paper estimates a dynamic programming model of retirement that incorporates multiple health dimensions, allowing differential effects on labor supply across occupations. Results show that the effect of cognitive health surges exponentially after age 65, and it explains a notable share of employment declines in cognitively demanding occupations. Under pension reforms, physical constraint mainly impedes manual workers from delaying retirement, whereas cognitive constraint dampens the response of clerical and professional workers. Multidimensional health thus unevenly exacerbate welfare losses across occupations.},

  title={Parental Health Penalty on Adult Children's Employment: Gender Difference and Long-Term Consequence},
  author={Jiayi Wen and Haili Huang},
  abstract={This paper examines the long-term gender-specific impacts of  parental health shocks on adult children's employment in China. We build up an inter-temporal cooperative framework to analyze household work decisions in response to parental health deterioration. Then employing an event-study approach, we establish a causal link between parental health shocks and a notable decline in female employment rates.  Male employment, however, remains largely unaffected. This negative impact shows no abatement up to eight years that are observable by the sample. These findings indicate the  consequence of ``growing old before getting rich'' for developing countries.},
