I am particularly interested in household and individual decisioin making at different stages of their life cycle, from the dynamic, heterogeneous and behavioral perspectives. To suitably explore these features, I exploit both reduced-form and structural methods and their combinations, such as RD, DID, IV with treatment effect heterogeneity, collective household model, dynamic discrete choice model, spatial equilibrium models etc.</p> </body></html>
