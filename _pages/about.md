Hi, welcome to my website! 

I am Jiayi Wen, an assistant professor at the Wang Yanan Institute for Studies in Economics (WISE) and the School of Economics at Xiamen University, China.

My research interests include labor economics, public economics, health economics and applied econometrics. I am particularly interested in household and individual decisioin making at different stages of their life cycle, from the dynamic, heterogeneous and behavioral perspectives. To suitably explore these features, I exploit both reduced-form and structural methods and their combinations, such as RD, DID, IV with treatment effect heterogeneity, collective household model, dynamic discrete choice model, spatial equilibrium models etc.
