Hi, welcome to my website! 

I am Jiayi Wen, an assistant professor at the Wang Yanan Institute for Studies in Economics (WISE) and the School of Economics at Xiamen University, China.

My research interests include labor economics, public economics, health economics and applied econometrics. I am particularly interested in household and individual decisioin making at different stages of their life cycle, from the dynamic, heterogeneous and behavioral perspectives. To suitably explore these features, I exploit both reduced-form and structural methods and their combinations, such as RD, DID, IV with treatment effect heterogeneity, collective household model, dynamic discrete choice model, spatial equilibrium models etc.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
