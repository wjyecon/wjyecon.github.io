Hi, welcome to my website! 

I am Jiayi Wen, an assistant professor at the Wang Yanan Institute for Studies in Economics (WISE) and the School of Economics at Xiamen University, China.

My research interests include labor economics, public economics, health economics and applied econometrics. I am particularly interested in individual decisioin making at different stages of the life cycle, from dynamic, heterogeneous and behavioral perspectives. To explore these features, I am interested in combining economic theory with various empirical methods -- both reduced-form and structural, such as RD, DID, IV with treatment effect heterogeneity, cooperative/non-cooperative household model, dynamic discrete choice model, spatial equilibrium models etc.

Recently, I will attend and make presentations at the following meetings:
May 3–4, 2024, The 29th Annual Meeting of The Society of Labor Economists (SOLE), Portland, USA
June 7-9, 2024, The 2024 Conference of the International Association for Applied Econometrics (IAAE China 2024), Xiamen, China
June 28-30, 2024, The Asian Meeting of Econometrics Society, Hangzhou, China
August 18-22, 2025, World Congress of the Econometric Society, Seoul, Korea
